    <p>Lacuna Lab is a community of creative tinkerers. We are dedicated to the imaginative exploration of art and technology, in the original sense of "technology": the application of scientific knowledge for practical (and possibly impractical) purposes. This means that, although many of us work with computers and code, we're interested in all disciplines! So whether you're into music and machinery, or dance and d&eacute;coupage, you and your creative energy are welcome! We enjoy learning and playing with tools that make our brains and our dreams come to life! </p>
    <p>We are building a community. That means: if you're just looking for a quiet desk where you can work alone and avoid eye contact with everyone else, you might want to try any of the myriad other co-working spaces Berlin has to offer. Naturally everyone needs time to work on their own projects, and this space is designed for that, but we're also interested in interaction and communication, in the spark of magic that happens when different skills and viewpoints collide, and in creating projects that exceed the sum of their parts.</p>
    <p>Whether you consider yourself to be a beginner or an expert, a theorist or a practitioner, we invite you to join us!</p>
