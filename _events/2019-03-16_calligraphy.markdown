Nastaʿlīq script is traditionally the most predominant style in Persian calligraphy. It was developed in Iran in the 14th and 15th centuries. The script is well known for its fluid style. It has short verticals with no serifs and long horizontal strokes.
Nastaʿlīq remains very widely used in Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and some other countries for written poetry and as a form of art.

## ++ WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ++

## Day 1:

History, Theory and Technique

- Some good old history and theory
- Learning the writing technique: the lettering design of all the alphabet in Persian.
In this session, we will start to write our first  "A" to "Z", with 90% of the class dedicated to practice and 10% to theory.

## Day 2: 

Produce Your Own Work

- We kick start the day by learning to write your own name. 
- For the most part of this day, we focus on learning about form and composition. You will learn about Siah-Mashq ("black drill") panels, which communicate via composition and form, rather than content. For this session, you will get very creative and playful, where you will be developing your own compositions.

## ++ WHAT TO BRING AND WHAT TO TAKE AWAY ++

What to bring: 

- Your PATIENCE and SMILE
- An A4 folder to take away your creations
- Ink Container (Davaat)  [There will be a limited number of containers to share between everyone at the workshop. Bring a very small container with you so I can prepare an ink container (with ink and Ligeh) that you can take home for further practice. It is important that the container should be small, shallow and with a wide opening, so the pen can easily enter]
- Ruler, (and/or compass ) to draw lines and circles, or any other shape you want to make on the second day.
