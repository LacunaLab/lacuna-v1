Lacuna Lab is entering its fourth year of existence and we would like to celebrate that!
In a combined exhibition Lacuna Lab members will present their latest works, accompanied by drinks and music to celebrate Lacuna Lab’s third birthday! 
Join us in a special, pop-up exhibition space for explorations in technology, art, science, orbital space, artificial intelligence and performative arts.  We look forward to sharing another year of Lacuna Lab with you all.
