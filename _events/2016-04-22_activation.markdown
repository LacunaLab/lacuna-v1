For three days, Spektrum is overgrown by Lacuna Lab, a Berlin-centred collective of trans-disciplinary artists. For the collective's inaugural exhibition, spores of ideas waft across the canal from their studio on Paul-Lincke-Ufer, taking root as a multi-channel network of biology- and technology-based pieces. These objects and installations draw input from their surroundings in Spektrum, the audience, and one another, creating a playful environment of screens, textiles, lights, lasers, plants, water vapor, and interwoven generative sounds. Opening with a live-generated audio-visual-dance performance, this exhibition investigates collaboration, perception, growth and decay.

PROJECTS**
GREENHOUSE
The Greenhouse is an immersive sensory environment, a temporary passage between rooms of the exhibition. This structure contains living and non-living matter – and things in between. The climate inside is regulated with humidifiers. Additional blacklights add an atmosphere of lush growth. It is an embodiment of Lacuna Lab itself and a collaboration between all of its members.

FIREFLIES - Abe Pazos, Mei-Fang Liau 
Fireflies is a collaborative spatial sound experience. The participants use their mobile devices to virtually approach others in the same room, communicating through generative visuals and abstract sounds. The harmony or dissonance of the sound guides the participants in their social exploration, making them aware of how connected or individual they are.

TYCHO - Thomas Heidtmann, Soma Holiday, Jemma Woolmore 
Tycho is an interactive object that mimics the shape and behaviour of the James Webb Space Telescope by capturing light with a sensor and transmitting its colour via LEDs to a mirrored hexagonal surface, where it modulates a projection sequence inspired by images of the birth and death of stars.

TENDRIL RECURSION - Sarah Hermanutz, Mei-Fang Liau, Assi Pakkanen, Peter Kolski, Ramin Soleymani
Inspired by time, growth and decay, this atmospheric performance connects contemporary dance with a live-generated musical score and projected visuals. Wearing a costume embedded with textile sensors, the dancer acts as conductor of the generative graphics and musical variations. This performance explores the human interconnection with nature and technology.

IN ALVEO - Sé Sneaky, Joa Ritter, Yoko Iki, Sarah Hermanutz	
In Alveo is an exploration of the connection between mother and baby during a natural birth. You are with your baby for every movement (s)he has to make to navigate the birth canal. Through a multi-sensory interaction you use your own rhythms to support your baby.

ALTERNATIVE SOUNDTRACK - Claudine Chen, Abe Pazos, Sé Sneaky	
Walk into the room. Check your phone messages. What was that sound? Was it you? Altsound takes a bird's eye view of this microcosm, and feeds you sounds as you navigate the space. Sounds from disparate sources come and go depending on the ebb and flow of you and those around you.

THE ORACLE - Marcel Schwittlick, Ramin Soleymani
Chat to the Oracle of Lacuna via this terminal, sent from the past, giving you access to the collective mind of Lacuna Lab. Pick the brain and heart of Lacuna by starting a sentence, the oracle will finish for you, revealing nothing but the truth.

VECTOR GRAPHICS ON A LASER - Marcel Swittlick
Abstract constellations of lines, manifesting themselves into structures of unsettling order. Experiments in algorithmic spacial compositions of movements.

SATURATED NO.1 - Aurelia Friedland, Takuro Iwata, Jeremias Volker 
SATURATED No. 1 is the first in a series exploring data visualizations with color on a physical, human scale. As audiences enter and leave SPEKTRUM, a door counter sends saturated activity to an additive color display nearby.

THE PROCESS - Marcel Schwittlick 
The Process is an object representing the past. It's an approach towards documentation of the for outsiders invisible process of founding of the Lacuna Lab community and working space. The box is filled with leftovers carefully collected from the floor of the Lacuna Lab over the period of the first 8 months of its existence.
