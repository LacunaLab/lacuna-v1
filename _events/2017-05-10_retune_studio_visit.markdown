[Retune](https://retune.de/) works at the intersection of Art, Design and Technology. They organize conferences, curate events, conceptualize workshops and produce artworks & installations. For artists, for the community, and for clients.

For #13 of the Retune Studio Visit series, we at Lacuna Lab are welcoming the creative tech community of Berlin into our home. There will be 14 very short presentations and 6 installations all over the place.
