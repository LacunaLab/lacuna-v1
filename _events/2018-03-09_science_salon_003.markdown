This time we bring together a few friends to talk about community science, biohacking, methodologies and nomadic labs. A special topic for the evening will be SOIL and we hope to also hear a few words on some upcoming projects around soil ecology, urban gardening... If you like the kind of art or science that gets your hands dirty, then come along. Our plan is to keep the talks part short so there is plenty of time for chats.
<br/><br/>
**Marc Dussellier** – Hackteria methodologies of temporary labs
Hackteria is an international network active since 2009 in the field of Open Source Biological Art. As a community platform hackteria tries to encourage the collaboration of scientists, hackers and artists to combine their expertise, share simple instructions to work with lifescience technologies and cooperate on the organization of workshops, gatherings, retreats and [durational temporary labs](https://www.hackteria.org/wiki/Main_Page#HackteriaLabs.2C_Temporary_Labs_and_Collaborative_Production_Events). Especially the latter has been fundamental to establish international collaborations and initiate new projects. We will give an overview of how this radically transdisciplinary format has shaped our approach to community science.

**Julian Chollet** – The parallels between phage therapy and organic farming
What we can learn from the history, paradigms and celebrities of such seemingly unrelated fields.

Marc Dusseiller aka dusjagr is a nomadic researcher and workshopologist. He is part of the Center for Alternative Coconut Research and co-founder of SGMK and the Hackteria network. He loves making DIWO laboratories for creative biological experimentation and works in an integral way, combining science, art and education. He has worked as guest faculty and mentor at various schools, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore (IN), UCSB (USA) and in Switzerland, FHNW, HEAD, ETHZ. He lives and works in Zürich,Taipei and Yogyakarta. He also loves coconuts.
<br/><br/>
Julian Chollet is a curious student and informal teacher with a background in molecular biology. He is working on the endless and under-explored biodiversity of microbes, fungi and phages, with the aim to liberate the world from microphobia through workshopology, fermentation and microscopy. He is a member of the Global Hackteria Network and founder of the non-profit association mikroBIOMIK Society, which promotes intrinsic curiosity and participation in science - with a focus on invisible creatures.
