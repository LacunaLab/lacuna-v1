## Description
The exhibition 'A Vital Piece of Information – Fragments of a Greater Context' brings together two contemporary artistic positions from India and Pakistan, intersecting in their inquiry on information, technology, humans and time. Their specific topics of interest, methods, and perspectives are fundamentally different, yet they are united in their wish to reveal a hidden truth that is constituting our present. 

Noor us Sabah Saeed from Pakistan takes us to Indus river, where she is looking into its current threats from climate change. Additionally, she investigates archaeological technologies to find out reasons for the disappearance of Sarasvati river and Harappan Civilization, in an effort to speculate further and retell the story of Indus differently. By investigating relations between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human consumption patterns related to YouTube, Indian artist Pratyush Raman plays with the narrative of users engaging in consumption and becoming a part of the production, aiming to raise awareness and to reflect on it. As a relevant fragment in itself, both artistic positions refer to the greater and more complex context that constructs our past, present and future.

Pratyush is a practising artist from Bangalore, where his work revolves around education, technology and playfulness of mathematics.

In Serendipity Arts Festival, his installation work, Breathe Pong reconstructed Pong, one of the earliest arcade games, as an interactive reflection of breathing. He uses code, music and painting as his media of expression.
