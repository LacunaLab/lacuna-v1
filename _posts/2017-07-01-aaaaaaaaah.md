This is an example post. In the first paragraph, there's some text describing what I am doing today.

I can put in some pictures here from the internet.

Let's include a vimeo embed link here.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/191187346" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

Or a youtube link instead:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQobrRnnWCo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Or maybe a soundcloud embed.

<iframe width="40%" height="350" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/5838599&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

Because it's jekyll there is no limit to how we can customize the layout of our content. Some ideas for things we can add as an "include":

 * Image carousel or lightbox
 * Support for canvas/paper/p5.js sketch embeds or other kinds of dynamic content
 * what else?
