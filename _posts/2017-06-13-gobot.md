Gobot! This is an experimental new openframeworks application that uses a deep learning library called [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) to automatically play the ancient game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) online. It uses a computer vision library to scrape the screen pixels of an online Go website and grab the current board position. It then recommends to you the next move. See it in action here:

The next thing I want to do to it is add mouse clicking functionality (already halfway there) so it can actually make the moves fo me rather than just recommending them. That way I could like, for example, leave the house to go play lunch or something, and let Gobot play online for me, get me more ranking points. More soon!
