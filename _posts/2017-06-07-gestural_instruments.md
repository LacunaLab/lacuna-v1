Last week, I hosted a workshop at Lacuna called "[Gestural instruments](http://lacunalab.com/events/2017-06-04_gestural_instruments.html)," which was devoted to creating audiovisual instruments which were controlled using techniques from machine learning. Hiroshi took a nice picture of the workshop mid-way:

We had a lot of fun, and went until the early evening, developing lots of cool new projections and musical instruments in openFrameworks and Max/MSP.
